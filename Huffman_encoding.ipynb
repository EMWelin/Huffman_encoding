Now Chryses had come to the ships of the  Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a  great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of  Apollo wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath, and he besought  the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who  were their chiefs. \n",
